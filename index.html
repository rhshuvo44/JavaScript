          Basic Javascript interview questions
        </h2>
        <div class="p-5">
          <h2>1. What is JavaScript?</h2>
          <p>
            Javascript is an <b>interpreted</b> language. Because of the newer
            <b>ECMAScript</b> feature, it can be compiled as well. A browser is
            responsible to execute or run the Javascript using web APIs. We can
            use Node.js to execute the Javascript outside of the browser as
            well. So, <b>web APIs</b> are responsible to execute Javascript
            inside the browser. While <b>Node.js APIs</b> are responsible to
            execute the Javascript outside the browser.
          </p>

          <h2>2. What are the features of JavaScript?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Interpreted</li>
            <li>Dynamically typed</li>
            <li>Platform independent</li>
            <li>Object based</li>
            <li>Light-weight</li>
            <li>Synchronous</li>
            <li>Single-threaded</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. JavaScript Data Types</h2>
          <p>JavaScript supports 2 data types</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Primitive</li>
            <li>Object</li>
          </ol>
          <h5>Primitive Data Types</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Bigint</li>
            <li>Boolean</li>
            <li>Null</li>
            <li>Number</li>
            <li>String</li>
            <li>Symbol</li>
            <li>Undefined</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Object Data Types</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Object</li>
            <li>Array</li>
            <li>Map</li>

          </ul>

          <h2>4. What is ECMAScript?</h2>
          <p>
            ECMAScript is a <b>specification</b> to write standard Javascript.
            It provides some rules and regulations. Browsers implement these
            rules to create Javascript engines.
          </p>
          <h2>5. What are different versions of ECMAScript?</h2>

          <p>Here is the list of ES6 features.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>let and const Keywords</li>
            <li>Arrow Functions</li>

          <h2>7. What are scopes in Javascript?</h2>
          <p>
            The scope refers to the current execution context. It specifies the
            accessibility of variables and functions. There are three scopes in
            Javascript.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Global scope</li>
            <li>Function scope</li>

          <h2>9. Which one should we use between let, var, and const?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Always declare variables with the <b>const</b> keyword.</li>
            <li>
              If the value of a variable is going to change in the future, then
              declare it with the <b>let</b> keyword.
            </li>
            <li>Avoid using the <b>var</b> keyword.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>10. What is Temporal Dead Zone?</h2>
          <p>
            The Temporal Dead Zone is the behavior of Javascript where the state
            of a variable is not reachable. It only happens when we declare a
            variable with the let and const keyword. Accessing a variable with
            let and const before its declaration causes the Reference Error.
          </p>

          <h2>11. What is hoisting?</h2>
          <p>
            The hoisting is the process of moving variable and function
            declarations to the top of the scope. Javascript only hoists
            declaration. It does not hoist initializations.
          </p>

          <h2>12. Whether Javascript is object-oriented or object-based?</h2>
          <p>
            Javascript is object-based in nature. Because it does not support
            polymorphism. Polymorphism consists of method overloading and method
            overriding. There is no concept of overloading or overriding in
            Javascript. The default behavior of Javascript is to overwrite the
            function. Hence Javascript is an object-based programming language.

          Javascript interview questions on asynchronous operations
        </h2>
        <div class="p-5">
          <h2>13. Is Javascript synchronous or asynchronous?</h2>
          <p>
            Javascript is synchronous and blocking in nature. Synchronous means
            to execute code in sequence. It does not execute the next block of
            code until and unless the execution of earlier code.
          </p>

          <h2>14. How does Javascript execute asynchronous code?</h2>
          <p>
            Javascript uses callbacks, promises and async/await to execute
            asynchronous code.
          </p>

          <h2>15. What is callback?</h2>
          <p>
            The callback is a function passed to another function as an
            argument. This passed function executes later. Usually, callbacks
            achieve asynchronous operations in Javascript.
          </p>
          <img class="w-100 mb-3" src="img/CallBack.png" alt="" />
          <h2>16. What is callback hell?</h2>
          <p>
            The callback hell happens when we use multiple nested callbacks.
            This problem occurs for dependent asynchronous operations (where we
            need to wait for the result of the previous asynchronous call).
          </p>

          <img class="w-100 mb-3" src="img/callBackHell.png" alt="" />
          <h2>17. How can we avoid callback hell?</h2>
          <p>
            We can avoid the callback hell problem by using promise and
            async-await.
          </p>

          <h2>18. What is promise?</h2>
          <p>
            The promise is useful to achieve asynchronous programming in
            Javascript. It is an object representing the completion or failure
            of an asynchronous operation.
          </p>

          <p>
            The promise was introduced in ES6. It was introduced to overcome the
            limitations caused by the callback. The promise is useful for single
            as well as multiple asynchronous operations.
          </p>

          <h2>19. What are the states of promise?</h2>
          <p>A promise can be in one of these states:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Pending:</b> initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Fulfilled:</b> meaning that the operation completes
              successfully.
            </li>
            <li><b>Rejected:</b> meaning that the operation failed.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>20. What is promise chaining?</h2>
          <p>
            Promise chaining means passing a promise to another promise.
            Sometimes, we have to make an asynchronous call based on the result
            of the previous asynchronous call. For this purpose, we can use
            promise chaining. We can achieve the promise chaining by using
            <b>promise instance methods</b> (then(), catch(), and finally()).
          </p>

          <img class="w-100 mb-3" src="img/promise.png" alt="" />
          <h2>
            21. How can we achieve multiple parallel asynchronous requests using
            promise?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Sometimes we need to call multiple requests on a single page. We can
            achieve this by sending requests in parallel. The promise provides
            some helpful methods to work with parallel requests. Here is the
            list of methods.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>all()</li>
            <li>allSettled()</li>
            <li>any()</li>
            <li>race()</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>22. What is async and await?</h2>
          <p>
            The async keyword with a function represents that function as
            asynchronous. The async function returns the promise. Await keyword
            is used to represent the asynchronous operation inside the async
            function.
          </p>

          <p>The async and await is syntactic sugar over the promise.</p>

          <h2>
            24. Which one is better between callback, promise and async-await?
          </h2>

          <p>
            The callback is the old way to handle asynchronous operations. The
            promise provides a better way to handle asynchronous operations. It
            provides different methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            Async and await is the syntactic sugar over the promise. It provides
            a way to write asynchronous code in a synchronous way. In modern
            applications, a lot of developers prefer async and await since it is
            easy to write and maintain.

            inner function has access to the outer functionâ€™s variables and
            parameters. The outer function should return an inner function to
            the outside world.
          </p>

          <p>
            Generally, closures were useful to achieve encapsulation in
            JavaScript before the introduction of class.

          <h2>26. What is an anonymous function?</h2>
          <p>
            An anonymous function is a function without a name. Mostly, it is
            useful for three purposes.
          </p>

          <p>
            We can store an anonymous function in a variable. It can be passed
            as an argument to another function. Similarly, we can return an
            anonymous function from a function.
          </p>
          <h2>27. What is a function expression?</h2>
          <p>
            It is possible to store a function into a variable in Javascript.
            The entire term is known as a function expression. We can call the
            variable to execute the stored function.
          </p>

          <h2>28. What is an arrow function?</h2>
          <p>
            An arrow function is a just syntactic sugar over function
            expression. It is also termed a fat arrow function. It is the
            shortest syntax to declare a function.
          </p>

          <img class="w-100 mb-3" src="./img/arrow function.png" alt="" />
          <h2>29. What is first-class function?</h2>
          <p>
            A programming language is said to have a first-class function if the
            function in that language is treated like any other variable. In
            such a language, we can pass the function to another function
            (callback). We can store a function into a variable. Moreover, we
            can return a function from another function (closure).
          </p>
          <h2>30. What is first-order function?</h2>
          <p>
            A first-order function is a function that doesnâ€™t accept another
            function as an argument. As well as it doesnâ€™t return a function.
          </p>

          <img class="w-100 mb-3" src="./img/order-fun.png" alt="" />
          <h2>31. What is higher-order function?</h2>
          <p>
            The higher-order function accepts a function as an argument. Besides
            that, it also returns the function as a value.
          </p>

          <img class="w-100 mb-3" src="./img/high-order-fun.png" alt="" />
          <h2>32. What is unary function?</h2>
          <p>
            A unary function is a function that accepts exactly one parameter.
          </p>
          <img class="w-100 mb-3" src="./img/unary-fun.png" alt="" />
          <h2>33. What is pure function?</h2>
          <p>
            A pure function is a function that returns the same output over the
            input. It never mutates the global variables. A pure function never
            modifies the global state of variables or any other data members. It
            only depends on the input arguments of the function.
          </p>

          <img class="w-100 mb-3" src="./img/pure-Fun.png" alt="" />
          <p>Some common terminologies for the pure function are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A function that doesnâ€™t modify the existing memory location is
              called pure function.
            </li>
            <li>
              A function that doesnâ€™t modify the actual parameter is called pure
              function.
            </li>
            <li>
              A mutation is a bad thing. So never modify the actual parameter of
              the function.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>34. What is IIFE?</h2>
          <p>
            IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression. It starts
            its execution immediately after the definition. There is a general
            rule in JavaScript. Never pollute a global scope. Writing function
            in global scope is not a good thing. IIFE creates a function in a
            local scope.
          </p>

          <p>
            IIFE prevents access of variables to the outside world. It also
            prevents pollution of the global scope. Here is an example of IIFE.
          </p>

          <img class="w-100 mb-3" src="./img/iife-fun.png" alt="" />
          <h2>35. What is currying function?</h2>
          <p>
            Currying is the process of converting a function with n arguments
            into n number of functions.
          </p>
          <img class="w-100 mb-3" src="./img/currying-fun.png" alt="" />
          <h2>36. What is nested function?</h2>
          <p>
            The nested function is a function that is defined inside another
            function.
          </p>

          <img class="w-100 mb-3" src="./img/nasted-fun.png" alt="" />
          <h2>37. What is â€˜thisâ€™ keyword in JavaScript?</h2>
          <p>
            Javascript runtime sets the context for each function. The context
            is identified by using this keyword. The this keyword refers to the
            context where the function is called. It does not belong to the
            context where the function was created.
          </p>

          <p>
            In an arrow function, this always points to the current surrounding
            context. It means where the function is created. We cannot change
            the context of an arrow function.
          </p>

          <h2>38. What is call() method?</h2>
          <p>
            We can change the context of the function using the call() method.
            We can explicitly specify where this should refer to.
          </p>

          <img class="w-100 mb-3" src="./img/call.png" alt="" />
          <h2>39. What is apply() method?</h2>
          <p>
            We can use apply() method to change the context of function similar
            to like call() method. The only difference is we can pass the
            parameters as an array.
          </p>

          <img class="w-100 mb-3" src="./img/apply.png" alt="" />
          <h2>40. What is bind() method?</h2>
          <p>
            The bind() method is also useful to change the context of a
            function. It was introduced in ES5. The bind() method does not
            execute the function immediately. Instead, it returns a new function
            with the context.
          </p>

        </h2>
        <div class="p-5">
          <h2>42. What is class in Javascript?</h2>
          <p>
            The class is a template to create objects. The class is a special
            function in Javascript. Basically, it is the syntactic sugar over
            function prototype. It is introduced in ES6.
          </p>

          <h2>43. How to create private members in class?</h2>
          <p>
            The class members are public by default. We can create private class
            members by using the hash (#) prefix.
          </p>
          <img src="./img/privated member.png" alt="" class="w-100 mb-3" />
          <h2>44. How to create static members in class?</h2>
          <p>
            We can create static properties and methods in class using the
            static keyword. We can access static members by using this:
            className.property or className.method.
          </p>
          <img src="./img/static member.png" alt="" class="w-100 mb-3" />
          <h2>45. What is template string?</h2>
          <p>
            We can write string using backticks () in Javascript. It provides a
            better way to write multiline strings. Moreover, we can insert a
            variable inside it using the ${} syntax.
          </p>

          <h2>46. What are default parameters?</h2>
          <p>
            Default parameters allow us to initialize function parameters to
            default values. They were introduced in ES6. We had to use the
            logical OR operator for default values prior to default parameters.
          </p>

          <h2>47. What is spread operator?</h2>
          <p>
            The spread operator expands iterables (array, object, string) into a
            single value. Here is a list of uses of the spread operator.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Spreading arrays, objects, and strings into single value.</li>
            <li>Copying an array.</li>

          <p>
            Rest parameter is an improved version of handling function
            parameters. We can pass any number of parameters to a function.
            These parameters can be accessed like an array.

          <p>
            The event bubbling is the type of event propagation. In such a case,
            when we trigger the event of the innermost element, it successively
            triggers the event of all the parent elements till the outermost

          <p>
            Event capturing is the type of event propagation. In such a case,
            when we trigger the event of the outermost element, it successively

          <h2>60. What is call stack?</h2>
          <p>
            The call stack is used to keep track of multiple function calls. It
            is like a real stack in data structures. We use a call stack to
            memorize which function is running right now.
          </p>

          <h2>61. What is event loop?</h2>
          <p>
            The event loop is a queue of callback functions. When an async
            function executes, the callback function is pushed into the queue.
            The queue places it onto the function execution stack whenever the
            stack becomes empty.

            JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight
            text-based medium to store and transmit data across networks. It is
            generally useful for transmitting and storing data in modern
            applications.
          </p>

          <h2>66. JSON methods in Javascript</h2>
          <p>JSON offers two methods to work with it.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              parse(): The method converts a JSON string to a corresponding
              Javascript object or value.
            </li>
            <li>
              stringify(): The method converts a Javascript object or value to a
              valid JSON string.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>67. JSON data types</h2>
          <p>JSON supports the following data types.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>String</li>
            <li>Number</li>
            <li>Boolean</li>
            <li>Null</li>
            <li>Object</li>
            <li>Array</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>68. What is strict mode in Javascript?</h2>
          <p>
            Strict mode allows writing code in a strict operating context. We
            can write secure Javascript code using it. It notifies bad syntax by
            throwing errors. We can declare strict mode at global as well as
            function scope.
          </p>

          <h2>69. What is NaN?</h2>
          <p>
            NaN stands for Not a Number. It represents a value that is not a
            valid number. We get this value whenever we try to perform
            mathematical operations on an invalid number.
          </p>

          <h2>70. What is undefined?</h2>
          <p>
            The undefined property indicates that a variable has no value or is
            not declared at all. The type of undefined is undefined too. We can
            empty any variable by setting the value to undefined. The function
            returns undefined if a value is not returned.
          </p>

          <img src="./img/undefile.png" alt="" class="w-100 mb-3" />
          <h2>71. What is null?</h2>
          <p>
            The null is one of Javascriptâ€™s primitive values. It represents the
            absence of object value. The type of null is Object. We empty a
            variable by setting the value to null.
          </p>

          <h2>72. What is difference between undefined and null?</h2>

          <table class="table">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th scope="col">undefined</th>
                <th scope="col">null</th>
              </tr>

            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>
                  It indicates that a variable has no value or is not declared
                  at all.

          <h2>73. What is the difference between == and ===?</h2>
          <p>
            The == stands for comparison operator. This operator transforms both
            the operand to the same type before comparison.
          </p>

          <p>
            The === stands for strict equality comparison operator. This
            operator returns false if the operands are not of the same type.
          </p>

          <h2>75. What is call by value?</h2>
          <p>
            We can invoke a function in two ways: call by value or call by
            reference. While invoking a function, we pass values of variables to
            it. If the function changes the value of the parameter, then this
            change doe not reflect globally or in the calling function.
          </p>

          <p>Primitive data types are passed to functions by value.</p>

          <h2>76. What is call by reference?</h2>
          <p>
            While invoking a function, we pass the address (reference) of
            variables to it instead of the actual value. If the function changes
            the value of the parameter, then this change reflects globally or in
            the calling function.
          </p>

          <p>Object data types are passed to function as a reference.</p>

                <td>
                  Deep copy means copying all the values from the original
                  variable and disconnecting.

                <td>
                  It disconnects from the original variable and creates a
                  separate copy.

          <h2>78. Which memory Javascript uses?</h2>
          <p>Javascript uses both stack and heap memory.</p>

          <h2>79. Does Javascript use garbage collection?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes. javascript uses the garbage collection technique. Once there is
            no use of variables, they become ready to be garbage collected. It
            is taken care of by the Javascript engine itself.
