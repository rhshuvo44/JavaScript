          Basic Javascript interview questions
        </h2>
        <div class="p-5">
          <h2>1. What is JavaScript?</h2>
          <p>
            Javascript is an <b>interpreted</b> language. Because of the newer
            <b>ECMAScript</b> feature, it can be compiled as well. A browser is
            responsible to execute or run the Javascript using web APIs. We can
            use Node.js to execute the Javascript outside of the browser as
            well. So, <b>web APIs</b> are responsible to execute Javascript
            inside the browser. While <b>Node.js APIs</b> are responsible to
            execute the Javascript outside the browser.
          </p>

          <h2>2. What are the features of JavaScript?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Interpreted</li>
            <li>Dynamically typed</li>
            <li>Platform independent</li>
            <li>Object based</li>
            <li>Light-weight</li>
            <li>Synchronous</li>
            <li>Single-threaded</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. JavaScript Data Types</h2>
          <p>JavaScript supports 2 data types</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Primitive</li>
            <li>Object</li>
          </ol>
          <h5>Primitive Data Types</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Bigint</li>
            <li>Boolean</li>
            <li>Null</li>
            <li>Number</li>
            <li>String</li>
            <li>Symbol</li>
            <li>Undefined</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Object Data Types</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Object</li>
            <li>Array</li>
            <li>Map</li>
            <li>Set</li>
            <li>Date</li>
            <li>Error</li>
            <li>Json</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. What is ECMAScript?</h2>
          <p>
            ECMAScript is a <b>specification</b> to write standard Javascript.
            It provides some rules and regulations. Browsers implement these
            rules to create Javascript engines.
          </p>
          <h2>5. What are different versions of ECMAScript?</h2>

          <h2>6. What are features of ES6?</h2>
          <p>Here is the list of ES6 features.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>let and const Keywords</li>
            <li>Arrow Functions</li>
            <li>Default Parameters</li>
            <li>Template Strings</li>
            <li>Destructuring Assignment</li>

          </ul>

          <h2>7. What are scopes in Javascript?</h2>
          <p>
            The scope refers to the current execution context. It specifies the
            accessibility of variables and functions. There are three scopes in
            Javascript.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Global scope</li>
            <li>Function scope</li>
            <li>Block scope</li>
          </ol>

                <td>Cannot re-declare but it can be updated</td>

              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Hoisted and initialized to undefined.</td>
                <td>Hoisted but not initialized.</td>
                <td>Hoisted but not initialized.</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <h2>9. Which one should we use between let, var, and const?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Always declare variables with the <b>const</b> keyword.</li>
            <li>
              If the value of a variable is going to change in the future, then
              declare it with the <b>let</b> keyword.
            </li>
            <li>Avoid using the <b>var</b> keyword.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>10. What is Temporal Dead Zone?</h2>
          <p>
            The Temporal Dead Zone is the behavior of Javascript where the state
            of a variable is not reachable. It only happens when we declare a
            variable with the let and const keyword. Accessing a variable with
            let and const before its declaration causes the Reference Error.
          </p>

          <h2>11. What is hoisting?</h2>
          <p>
            The hoisting is the process of moving variable and function
            declarations to the top of the scope. Javascript only hoists
            declaration. It does not hoist initializations.
          </p>

          <h2>12. Whether Javascript is object-oriented or object-based?</h2>
          <p>
            Javascript is object-based in nature. Because it does not support
            polymorphism. Polymorphism consists of method overloading and method
            overriding. There is no concept of overloading or overriding in
            Javascript. The default behavior of Javascript is to overwrite the
            function. Hence Javascript is an object-based programming language.

        <h2 class="bg-success text-white p-3">
          Javascript interview questions on asynchronous operations
        </h2>
        <div class="p-5">
          <h2>13. Is Javascript synchronous or asynchronous?</h2>
          <p>
            Javascript is synchronous and blocking in nature. Synchronous means
            to execute code in sequence. It does not execute the next block of
            code until and unless the execution of earlier code.
          </p>

          <h2>14. How does Javascript execute asynchronous code?</h2>
          <p>
            Javascript uses callbacks, promises and async/await to execute
            asynchronous code.
          </p>

          <h2>15. What is callback?</h2>
          <p>
            The callback is a function passed to another function as an
            argument. This passed function executes later. Usually, callbacks
            achieve asynchronous operations in Javascript.
          </p>
          <img src="img/CallBack.png" alt="" />
          <h2>16. What is callback hell?</h2>
          <p>
            The callback hell happens when we use multiple nested callbacks.
            This problem occurs for dependent asynchronous operations (where we
            need to wait for the result of the previous asynchronous call).
          </p>

          <img src="img/callBackHell.png" alt="" />
          <h2>17. How can we avoid callback hell?</h2>
          <p>
            We can avoid the callback hell problem by using promise and
            async-await.
          </p>

          <h2>18. What is promise?</h2>
          <p>
            The promise is useful to achieve asynchronous programming in
            Javascript. It is an object representing the completion or failure
            of an asynchronous operation.
          </p>

          <p>
            The promise was introduced in ES6. It was introduced to overcome the
            limitations caused by the callback. The promise is useful for single
            as well as multiple asynchronous operations.
          </p>

          <h2>19. What are the states of promise?</h2>
          <p>A promise can be in one of these states:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Pending:</b> initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Fulfilled:</b> meaning that the operation completes
              successfully.
            </li>
            <li><b>Rejected:</b> meaning that the operation failed.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>20. What is promise chaining?</h2>
          <p>
            Promise chaining means passing a promise to another promise.
            Sometimes, we have to make an asynchronous call based on the result
            of the previous asynchronous call. For this purpose, we can use
            promise chaining. We can achieve the promise chaining by using
            <b>promise instance methods</b> (then(), catch(), and finally()).
          </p>

          <img src="img/promise.png" alt="" />
          <h2>
            21. How can we achieve multiple parallel asynchronous requests using
            promise?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Sometimes we need to call multiple requests on a single page. We can
            achieve this by sending requests in parallel. The promise provides
            some helpful methods to work with parallel requests. Here is the
            list of methods.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>all()</li>
            <li>allSettled()</li>
            <li>any()</li>
            <li>race()</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>22. What is async and await?</h2>
          <p>
            The async keyword with a function represents that function as
            asynchronous. The async function returns the promise. Await keyword
            is used to represent the asynchronous operation inside the async
            function.
          </p>

          <p>The async and await is syntactic sugar over the promise.</p>
